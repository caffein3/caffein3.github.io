        You might have came from a GitHub repository, or just randomly stumbled upon it. Anyways, there is nothing here.
        This is just a place for me to test my HTML skills (which is zero).

        <p class="gentext">23/02/2023: The website looks much better now (that's what I think) because i fixed a lot of CSS
        stuff. I still haven't checked how it would look on different platforms, so that's another job for me. Don't
        view the source for this page, as it looks absolutely disgusting.
