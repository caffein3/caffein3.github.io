        If you want to watch <a href="https://youtube.com" ; class="hyperlink">YouTube</a> or search on<a href="//bing.com" ; class="hyperlink" ; title="yes it is a hyperlink">Bing</a>or <a href="//https://google.com" ; class="hyperlink"> Google</a>, the links are here. There is no point in being here.
